Just a tiny post.

I'm experiencing (maybe) some bugs in my blog project. Everything works fine when I use jekyll serve, and my mathjax support and new posts presentation suck when I upload my websit to my github repo...

Still figuring out why...But just too many exams coming. Busy AF these days.  I will probably fix them in May...
